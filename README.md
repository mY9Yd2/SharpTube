## About

Get YouTube channel/video/playlist information. This library is heavily inspired by the [jnsougata/aiotube](https://github.com/jnsougata/aiotube) project.  
I intentionally left out certain features because I don't use them, or because they either work or not for some videos.  
I don't guarantee that this library will work in every scenario, or that I will fix it if something breaks, because YT has changed some things.

## Example/Usage
